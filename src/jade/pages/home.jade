            p.block__copy Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu is a military art (bugei) that was introduced in the Tensho period (1573-1591) by its founder, Tamiya Heibei Narimasa. Narimasa, together with Katayama Hoki no kami Hisayasu (the founder of Hoki Ryu) and Sekiguchi Jushin (the founder of Sekiguchi Ryu) were pupiles of Hayashizake Jinsuke Shigenobu, the founder of iaijutsu.
            
            p.block__copy The style characteristics of the Tamiya school of swordsmenship are: First volume (Omote no maki) containing evelen kata and Second volume (Koran no maki) containing fourteen kata.
            
            p.block__copy As a serious course of study, learning Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu involves having a clear understanding of the concepts known as "Tamiya Nobility" and "Tamiya Purity".

      p.block__copy Training focuses on the harmonization of mind, body, and spirit through the practice and performance of kata (pre-arranged techniques). Techniques are practiced with the philosophy of the "sword which gives life (Katsujin no Ken)," as opposed to the "sword which takes life (Satsujin no Ken)."
      
      p.block__copy Emphasis is placed on basic techniques. To properly learn kata means studying 1) how to cut using the scabbard opening (sayaguchi) and 2) how to use the scabbard hand (sayate).
