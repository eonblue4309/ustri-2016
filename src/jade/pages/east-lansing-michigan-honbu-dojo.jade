      p.block__copy The Michiagan Honbu dojo is the headquarters for Tamiya Ryu Iajiutsu operations in the United States. Surrounded by a beautiful Japanese garden, this traditional dojo was built from plans based on a traditional Japanese training hall.
    
      p.block__copy All classes are by assignment and are held weekly throughout the year with the exception of a winter weather break - The dojo is unheated and Michigan winters are harsh!
