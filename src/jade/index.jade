          p Iaijutsu is a martial art (bujutsu) that strives to supress a sudden attack by the attacker against the defender using a single, swift stroke of the sword. 
          
          p Iaijutsu assumes that every attacker uses a Japanese long sword (Nihontou) and seeks to master the various principles of drawing, re-sheathing and using the sword.

          p Furthermore, iaijutsu is a martial way (budo) based on the doctrines of Buddhism. As it is said, "The sword and Zen act in unison." Iaijutsu practices its techniques with a humble and modest heart and continually trains the spirit.
