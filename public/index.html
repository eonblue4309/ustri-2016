                <p>Iaijutsu is a martial art (bujutsu) that strives to supress a sudden attack by the attacker against the defender using a single, swift stroke of the sword and seeks to master the various principles of drawing, re-sheathing and using the sword.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, iaijutsu is a martial way (budo) as it practiced with a humble and modest heart and continually trains the spirit.</p><a href="#" class="learn-more">Learn more</a>

                <p>Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu is a military art (bugei) that was introduced in the Tensho period (1573-1591) by its founder, Tamiya Heibei Narimasa. Narimasa, together with Katayama Hoki no kami Hisayasu (the founder of Hoki Ryu) and Sekiguchi Jushin (the founder of Sekiguchi Ryu) were pupiles of Hayashizake Jinsuke Shigenobu, the founder of iaijutsu.</p>
                <p>The style characteristics of the Tamiya school of swordsmenship are: First volume (Omote no maki) containing evelen kata and Second volume (Koran no maki) containing fourteen kata.</p>
                <p>As a serious course of study, learning Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu involves having a clear understanding of the concepts known as "Tamiya Nobility" and "Tamiya Purity".</p><a href="#" class="learn-more">Learn more</a>

          <h2 class="block__title block__title--underline block__title--light">United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu</h2>
          <p>Training focuses on the harmonization of mind, body, and spirit through the practice and performance of kata (pre-arranged techniques). Techniques are practiced with the philosophy of the "sword which gives life (Katsujin no Ken)," as opposed to the "sword which takes life (Satsujin no Ken)."</p>
          <p>Emphasis is placed on basic techniques. To proper learna kata means studying 1) how to cut using the scabbard opening (sayaguchi) and 2) how to use the scabbard hand (sayate).</p>
          <p>Occasionally students will also practice Kenshibu - a traditional Japanese dance utilizing sword and fan. Kenshibu is performed to the accompaniment of poems (sung in a style called Shigin) that depict famous events in Japanese history.</p>
